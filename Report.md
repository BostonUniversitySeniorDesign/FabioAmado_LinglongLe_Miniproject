[15 Minute Wifi Plot](./wifi_data_results/wifi_2021-09-14T12_43_54_results.png)

The link above contains the plotted result from an extended wifi scan, which ran for around 35 minutes, from 12:45 PM to 1:20 PM. In this plot, it is clear that there was some variation in the amount of cars detected at any one time, with the amount of cars detected ranging from 0 to 11 at any given time. In the plot there were periods of relatively high activity from 12:47 PM to 12:53 PM and from 1:03 PM to 1:13 PM, while the almost no activity was detected from 12:53 PM to 1:02 PM. Analyzing the results, it is clear that there were more cars passing by during the periods of high activity, while there was a lull in traffic during the period of low activity. 

One reason for this pattern could be due to workers returning from their lunch break. The period of highest activity was in the region of 12:47 PM to 12:53 PM, which is just before most peoples lunch breaks end. Thus the increased traffic in this period could be from people hoping to be back into their workplaces before 1:00pm after having lunch. The peaks in activity from 1:03 to 1:13 PM could also be attributed to lunch breaks. Workplaces could have been holding company activities or group lunches that were scheduled from 12:00 PM to 1:00 pm, and as such would not be worried about being back in the office before 1:00 pm. At no point in time of this scan however, were there any deadlocks or periods of extreme congestion, as shown by the variance in the data minute by minute. Had a traffic jam occurred, then there would be a more consistent amount of cars over time, without the jumps between highs and lows in the amount of detected cars.
